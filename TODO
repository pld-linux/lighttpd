# TODO:
- test mysql (failed at this time)
- mysql issue: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=76866
- fam over gamin is possible, just configure doesn't check other than gamin
- feature stat-cache-fam (doesn't work)
- lighttpd writes early startup messages to stderr, and if started from
  rc-scripts the stderr is closed which causes lighttpd to abort():

# NOTES:
- disable largefile, if you have 2.4 kernel to get sendfile() support, and don't need > 2GB file requests,

01:09:57  glen> stbuehler: ah sorry, i didn't notice as you didn't reply (hilite) me here..
01:13:52  glen> stbuehler: btw, what you think of this patch:
                http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/packages/lighttpd/lighttpd-mod_evasive-status_code.patch
01:17:52  stbuehler> the buffer_prepare_copy isn't really needed imho (and 255 seems to much for a long anyway)
01:18:11  stbuehler> and wasn't there a srv->tmp_buf for such things?
01:18:58  glen> ok i see it changes default 403 -> 503, that's probably bad too?
01:19:26  stbuehler> apart from that it looks good to me, although it changes the default status code to 503; and perhaps retry-after should
                     only be returned if it is not zero (i don't know what the rfc says)

01:20:25  stbuehler> i think 503 is a sane default and better than 403, so it should be ok to change the default
