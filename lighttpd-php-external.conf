# FastCGI server for PHP

# Sometimes you need to run old html file(s) as php pages, especially if you
# are migrating from Apache web server. To treat html pages as php you need to
# map multiple extensions to the same fastcgi server using fastcgi.map-extensions
# directive.
#fastcgi.map-extensions = (
#	".html" => ".php",
#	".php3" => ".php",
#)

fastcgi.server += (
	".php" => ((
		"socket" => "/var/run/php/fcgi.sock",
		# we enable check-local so you can use server.error-handler-404 for php files too
		"check-local" => "enable",
		"disable-time" => 1,
		"bin-copy-environment" => (
			"PATH", "SHELL", "USER"
		),
	))
)
